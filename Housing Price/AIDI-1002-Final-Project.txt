AIDI-1002 – AI Algorithms – Final Project 
The dataset shows the housing price in a city say “XYZ” over a period of time. 
The dataset contains the following variables: 

Independent Variables 

●	id - Unique ID for each home sold 
●	date - Date of the home sale 
●	bedrooms - Number of bedrooms 
●	bathrooms - Number of bathrooms, where .5 accounts for a room with a toilet but no shower
●	sqft_living - Square footage of the apartments interior living space 
●	sqft_lot - Square footage of the land space 
●	floors - Number of floors 
●	waterfront - A variable for whether the apartment was overlooking the waterfront or not 
●	view - An index from 0 to 4 of how good the view of the property was 
●	condition - An index from 1 to 5 on the condition of the apartment, 
●	grade - An index from 1 to 13, where 1-3 falls short of building construction and design, 7 has an average level of construction and design, and 11-13 have a high quality level of construction and design. 
●	sqft_above - The square footage of the interior housing space that is above ground level
●	sqft_basement - The square footage of the interior housing space that is below ground level yr_built - The year the house was initially built 
●	yr_renovated - The year of the house’s last renovation 
●	zipcode - What zipcode area the house is in 
●	sqft_living15 - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
●	sqft_lot15 - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors 

Dependent Variables 

price - Price of each home sold 

The Ask: Build atleast 5 ML models to predict the housing price.
