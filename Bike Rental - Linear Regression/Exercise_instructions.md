Exercise #1 Linear Regression


Instructions:


The objective of this assignment is for you to get familiar with ScikitLearn libraries and the Linear Regression algorithm. You are going to use a simple bicycle rental dataset to build a linear regression model using two parameters (independent variable: temperature, dependent variable: number of rented bicycles.) Please find more instructions in the attached jupyter notebook file(.ipynb).

Harness:
Please check the attached Jupyter notebook

Program output
<placeholder> bicycles will be rented if the temperature is -6 degrees Celsius
